# ISSUES

This file lists known issues and planned features for future `celib` releases.


## Issues

1. DOC: Docstrings for public code often incomplete or missing
2. DOC: Better integration with pydoc/Sphinx would be a nice to have


## Features

1. DB1: Implement more-complete support for MDVs (will likely have to deviate
		from how they're handled in Ox)
2. DB1: Improve implementation of `condense()` (see method docstring for
		details)
3. MRE: Consider whether to implement file writing
4. Consider porting non-analytical code from Ox e.g. timesheets, cost monitors,
   SharePoint data
