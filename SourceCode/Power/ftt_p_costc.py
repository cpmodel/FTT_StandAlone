Power cost-supply curves module.


Cost-supply curves give the cost of a resource as a function of its quantity, and
hence provide the **marginal cost** of each resource. For example, if a fossil fuel
resource is running out, the fuel cost increases. For e.g. hydropower, if there are
less accessible places to build, then the investment cost goes up. For variable
renewables, the load factor (the number of hours it delivers to the grid, divide by the
number of hours in a year).


Functions included:
    - marginal_costs_nonrenewables
        Calculates marginal cost of production of non renewable resources
    - cost_curves
        Calculates cost-supply curves for the power sector
