    Calculate new sales/investments for all FTT models (e.g. TEWI)

    1. If capacity has grown, the difference between the new capacity and the

    Capacity depreciation is based on the technology lifetime in the

        Capacity at the previous year
    shares: np.array
        Current shares (e.g. TEWS, MEWS)
